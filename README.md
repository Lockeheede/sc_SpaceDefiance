 Godot Game Program. Followed along with Heartbeast online. Highly recommended

# Update
 This was a really fun small and quick project to make. It made me think of the old days (even before Mario!) When a game could be made in 2 weeks. As a solo developer without a AAA budget, I can't really afford putting years into a game and spending boat loads of money on marketing and equipment. Godot was a breath of fresh air. I come from an Unreal Engine background, so I'm known for doing things the complicated way, trying to make huge games with great graphics. But, I wanted to take a step back after my first, highly ambitous game, took 3 years and didn't make much profit. 
 The approach is Nintendo, a company I always loved (though I did get a Genesis instead of an SNES). They made high quality games that don't care about pushing graphical boundaries. Their focus is gameplay, shelling out exclusives every month for the Nintendo Switch. They have way less sales than Playstation, but they were able to make more profit due to having less development costs. That's the route I want to go from now on. 
 If I end up on a big team one day using Unreal, that is a different story, and I will always keep my UE skills sharp. But when it comes to make solo indie games, I think I'll do the Godot route, at least for now. 

 # About the Game
  I followed along with a youTube named Heartbeast who had this Galaxy Defiance game tutorial. Compared to the huge projects I've followed along in Unreal (and Unity!) it was good making a complete game that didn't take months to finish. The game has 3 enemies, scaling difficulty, player controls, score and save system, music and sound effects, paralax backgrounds, GDScript (which is like Python) and uses Components for modularity in objects (known as Scenes). I had a great time! I even went to a different tutorial on youTube to learn how to build the game for the web so you can just play it!
